# CSS Grid Video Course

Hey! These are the starter files and finished solutions. Grab the full course over at [CSSGrid.io](https://CSSGrid.io).

## Course FAQ

### Q: I'm getting "This is meant to be run from within npm script."

Not sure why this is happening, but try these commands instead:

**windows:** `npm run start:win32`

**mac and linux:** `start:darwin:linux`

Very few people get this, but please contact me if you find out why `npm start` command isn't running.

### Q: I'm getting Browsersync Couldn't open browser (if you are using BrowserSync in a headless environment, you might want to set the open option to false)

This is because some versions of Firefox are "FirefoxDeveloperEdition" and some new downloads are "Firefox Developer Edition". If you had downloaded the browser before the course, just remove the spaces from the package.json command so it says "FirefoxDeveloperEdition"

### Q: I can't see the lines / numbers of Firefox' CSS Grid Inspection Tools

Make sure to turn off both "Use recommended performance settings" & "Use hardware acceleration when available“ within Preferences > Performance

## A note on Pull Requests

These are meant to be 1:1 copies of what is done in the video. If you found a better / different way to do things, great, but I will be keeping them the same as the videos.

The starter files + solutions will be updated if/when the videos are updated.

Thanks!
